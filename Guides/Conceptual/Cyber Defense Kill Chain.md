A concept developed by Lockheed Martin which describes the escalation process of an [[Attacker|attacker]] attempting to penetrate a [[Network|network's]] defenses.

****
## PRE-COMPROMISE
*Staging of an attack.*

**STAGE 1:**
***Reconnaissance***

The attacker gathers information about the target. [[Network Sniffing]] and [[Port Scanner|Port Scanners]] are used at this step.

**STAGE 2:**
***Weaponization***

The attacker creates an exploit and malicious payload to send to the target.

**STAGE 3:**
***Delivery***

The attacker sends the exploit and malicious payload to the target by email or other method.

****
## COMPROMISE
*The attack's initial exploits are being deployed onto the network.*

**STAGE 4:**
***Exploitation***

The exploits are executed.

**STAGE 5:**
***Installation***

[[Malware]] and [[Backdoor|Backdoors]] are being installed onto the target systems or network.

****
## POST-COMPROMISE
*The infiltration is complete, and the attacker will complete their mission.*

**STAGE 6:**
***Command and Control***

Remote control of the target is gained through a [[Command and Control (C2)|command and control]] channel or server.

**STAGE 7:**
***Action***

The attacker performs malicious actions like information theft or executes additional attacks on other devices on the network by working through the kill chain again.
