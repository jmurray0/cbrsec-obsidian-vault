A method of infiltration is the exploitation of vulnerabilities. An [[Attacker|attacker]] will scan computers to gain information about them.

**STEP 1:**
Gather information about the target.

This can be done in different ways, such as a [[Port Scanner|port scanner]] or [[Social Engineering|social engineering.]] The goal is to find out key information about the target computer and network, such as:
- [[Operating System]] and its version.
- [[Daemon|Daemons]] and [[Service (Windows)|Services]], depending on which applies.

**STEP 2:**
Create a plan of action.

Using the information found, research vulnerabilities in the [[operating system]] and software that is being run.

**STEP 3:**
Execute the plan of action.

If there are exploits already written for the software versions, then use them. Otherwise, start building them.
