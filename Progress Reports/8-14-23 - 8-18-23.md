This week has been rather uneventful for me.

This week I've read:

Cyber Security Essentials:
Finished.

NDG Linux Unhatched:
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2

This week I've done:
- Fresh installed Arch Linux to improve my workflow.
- Familiarized myself with `netdiscover`, `nmap`, and `dirbuster`
- Configured `gpsd` to show live coordinate data with `Marble`.
