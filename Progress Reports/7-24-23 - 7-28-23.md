This week has been short for me, and served as an introduction to the trade environment and increasing my familiarization with Linux systems.

This week I've read:

Intro to Cyber Security
- Chapter 1

This week I've done:
- Linux installation (Manjaro Linux, NixOS)

I spent a lot of time testing out various different configurations and I'm working together with Cole to learn NixOS and Nix Package Manager.

- Network troubleshooting

Troubleshooting bad adapters and configuration to allow access to the internet. I didn't succeed in the goal, but I tried my best. I found out that the adapter I was given was broken.
