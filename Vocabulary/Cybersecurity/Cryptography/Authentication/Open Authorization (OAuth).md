A standard protocol that enables an end user's credentials to access third party applications without exposing their password.

An end user can login to one web service with the credentials of another. Web service A requests an access token from web service B, resulting in a handshake and allowing the end user to seamlessly transition from web service A's login screen and accessing web service B's content.
