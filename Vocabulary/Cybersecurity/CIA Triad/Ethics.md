A person may act unethically and not be subject to prosecution, fines or imprisonment. This is because the action may not have been technically illegal. But that does not mean that the behavior is acceptable. Ethical behavior is fairly easy to ascertain. It is impossible to list all of the various unethical behaviors that can be exhibited by someone with cyber security skills. Below are just two. Ask yourself:

- Would I want to discover that someone has hacked into my computer and altered images in my social network sites?

- Would I want to discover that an IT technician whom I trusted to fix my network, told colleagues personal information about me that was gained while working on my network?

If your answer to any of these questions was ‘no’, then do not do such things to others.

**Corporate Ethical Issues**

Ethics are codes of behavior that are sometimes enforced by laws. There are many areas in cyber security that are not covered by laws. This means that doing something that is technically legal still may not be the ethical thing to do. Because so many areas of cyber security are not (or not yet) covered by laws, many IT professional organizations have created codes of ethics for persons in the industry. Below is a list of three organizations with Codes of Ethics:

- The CyberSecurity Institute (CSI)
- The Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)
- The Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP)
