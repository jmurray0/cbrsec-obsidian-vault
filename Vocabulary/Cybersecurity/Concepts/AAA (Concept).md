Colloquially referred to as "Triple A", it is a concept which describes access control protocols. There are 3 levels.

#### AUTHENTICATION
*Verifies the identity of a user to prevent unauthorized access.*

Users prove their identity with a username and password combination, ID card, or biometrics. One of the following must be provided:
- Something they know: Such as a password, PIN number, or secret word.
- Something they have: Such as a card, key fob, or token.
- Something they are: Such as a fingerprint, palm print, or voice recognition.

#### AUTHORIZATION
*Determines which resources users can access, as well as operations they can perform.*

[[Access Control List (ACL)]] is a system that determines whether a user has certain access privileges once the user authenticates. Authorization controls access to specific resources as well as broad scope permissions. Specific users may be locked out of using a device, or accessing a database or spreadsheet.

#### ACCOUNTING
*Keeping track of what users do.*

Tracking what users access, how much time they spend with them, how often they access them, and any changes made to the resources. A system can track each data transaction and provide auditing results.
