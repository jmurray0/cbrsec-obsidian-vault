In cyber security, the Kill Chain is the stages of an information systems attack. Developed by Lockheed Martin as a security framework for incident detection and response, the Cyber Kill Chain is comprised of the following stages:

**Stage 1. Reconnaissance** - The [[attacker]] gathers information about the target.

**Stage 2. Weaponization** - The attacker creates an exploit and malicious payload to send to the target.

**Stage 3. Delivery** - The attacker sends the [[exploit]] and malicious payload to the target by email or other method.

**Stage 4. Exploitation** - The exploit is executed.

**Stage 5 Installation** - [[Malware]] and backdoors are installed on the target.

**Stage 6. Command and Control** - Remote control of the target is gained through a command and control channel or server.

**Stage 7. Action** - The attacker performs malicious actions like information theft, or executes additional attacks on other devices from within the [[network]] by working through the Kill Chain stages again.
